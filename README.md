# startup for Stephen Brockbank. I'm adding this line of code to make a conflict. This will be my final project for cs260 class. This will be awesome. I've used github before and git so nothing is new to me. But I really like how easy it is to push changes and pull changes. This makes it easy to work on projects with people at the same time.
