Elevator Pitch: Introducing a new way to stay connected with friends and family through video sharing! Our website allows you to easily upload and view videos of your loved ones, no matter where they are in the world. Everyone can add their experiences to keep memories alive. Never miss a moment with our user-friendly platform.

Detailed description: This website will allow a user to do many things. First - they can create an event. Inside of this event they can upload pictures or videos. They can add a journal entry to this event on whatever they want to say about this event. They can share this event with others if they'd like. You can select which users can upload videos, pictures or journal entries of their own to this event. They then can select who can view this event. Another feature is that they can view their friends and families events - if they have been given permission.

Simon - learning:
Now I know how to make subdomains for my project. Honestly not entirely sure that's what I did, but it seems that way. Really easy to do. Also, very easy to create different pages and have links to them inside each page. The deployWebsites.sh file is amazing. It really does all the work. Github desktop is also very user friendly. Making pull requests or pushing commits is very intuitive. It took me a second to get my simon deployed becasue I wasn't naming my files correctly. So that was interesting. I need to take a closer look at the deployWebsites.sh file to know why that was not working. Once I changed the file names it worked great.



Simon - CSS
What I really learned here was that it is difficult to make the website appear the way you envision it. It's important to deploy often to see what it actually looks like, instead of doing it all blind. I spent too much time changing things when they didn't even look good.

Simon - JS
Some things I learned from this is to just be careful to use the correct id names. The play wasn't working for awhile because I was not refrencing the correct thing. Javascript makes it really easy to use local storage data to keep record of whats happened.
