Elevator Pitch: Introducing a new way to stay connected with friends and family through video sharing! Our website allows you to easily upload and view videos of your loved ones, no matter where they are in the world. Everyone can add their experiences to keep memories alive. Never miss a moment with our user-friendly platform.

Detailed description: This website will allow a user to do many things. First - they can create an event. Inside of this event they can upload pictures or videos. They can add a journal entry to this event on whatever they want to say about this event. They can share this event with others if they'd like. You can select which users can upload videos, pictures or journal entries of their own to this event. They then can select who can view this event. Another feature is that they can view their friends and families events - if they have been given permission.
